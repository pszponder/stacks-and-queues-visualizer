# System Requirements Specification:

## Goals:

Create an application which allows the user to explore the different functionalities of a stack and queue to get a better understanding of how it works.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to be able to select whether I experiment with a stack or a queue.
2. As a user, I want to be able to add values into either the stack or the queue from a text-box.

3. As a user, when using the stack, I want to be able to push (insert) values onto the stack when I press a button.
4. As a user, when using the stack, I want to be able to pop (remove) values off of the stack when I press a button.
5. As a user, when using the stack, I want to be able to peek (look at top value) at which value will be removed from the stack next when I press a button.

6. As a user, when using the queue, I want to be able to queue (insert) values onto the queue when I press a button.
7. As a user, when using the queue, I want to be able to dequeue (remove) values from the queue when I press a button.
8. As a user, when using the queue, I want to be able to view the head of the queue (next element to be removed from the queue) when I press a button.
9. As a user, when using the queue, I want to be able to view the tail of the queue (last element added to the queue) when I press a button.
